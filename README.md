# Real-Time Action Recognition in Multi-Person Pose Estimation Using MediaPipe

This project focuses on recognizing human actions in real time using multi-person pose estimation. We use **MediaPipe** to extract 2D skeletal landmarks, **YOLOv8** for multiple person detection, and train a **Random Forest** model to classify actions.
